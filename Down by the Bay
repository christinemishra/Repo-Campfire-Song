Down by the bay - Raffi

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever you ever see a goose
kissing a moose?" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a whale 
With a polka dot tail?" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a lama 
running to Alabama" 
Down by the bay

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a sloth
moving fast as cheetah?" 
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever get hit by a  
lightning speed sleepers?" 
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Did you ever see a moose
play a Kazoo?"
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay
Where the watermelons grow
I dare not go
For if I do
My mother will say
"Have you ever seen gost
driving a boat?"
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Did you ever see a squirrel
do a twirl?" 
Down by the bay...

Down by the bay 
Where the watermelons grow 
Back to my home 
I dare not go 
For if I do 
My mother will say 
"Have you ever seen a ant
carry a rat?" 
Down by the bay...
